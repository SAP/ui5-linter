# RFC 0000 Fancy Title
*Disclaimer: This template is derived from the great [RFC template](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/blob/main/0000-template.md) that Yarn has come up with. (You may remove this disclaimer).*

## Summary
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with UI5 linter to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean UI5 linter or any of its sub-components documentation must be re-organized or altered?

How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing UI5 linter users?

## Drawbacks
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

Why should we not do this? Please consider the impact on teaching people to use UI5 linter, on the integration of this feature with existing and planned features, on the impact of churn on existing users.

There are trade-offs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding
<!-- You can either remove the following explanatory text or move it into this comment for later reference -->

*This section should be removed (i.e. resolved) before merging*

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD? Are there any second priority decisions left to be made?
